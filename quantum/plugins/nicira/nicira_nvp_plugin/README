-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview and pre-requisites

    This is a Quantum plugin that can talk to a set of NVP controllers and
    implements the core Quantum v2 api.  In order to use it you must have
    Nicira NVP running and configured.  You must also have Quantum installed
    and configured.

NVP Plugin configuration

    1) Database configuration
    The NVP plugin leverages the Quantum database. The following connection
    parameters should be specified:
    - sql_connection: Database connection string
    - sql_max_retries: Maximum number of connection attempts (default 10)
    - reconnect_interval: Gap between connection attempts (default 2 seconds)
    2) NVP (general)
    - max_lp_per_bridged_ls: Maximum number of ports of a logical switch on a
    bridged transport zone (default 64)
    - concurrent_connections: Number of connects to each controller node
    (default 3)
    - failover_time: Time from when a connection pool is switched to another
    controller during failures.
    3) NVP cluster
    The Quantum NVP plugin allow for configuring multiple clusters.
    Each cluster configuration section must be declared in the following way
    in the configuration file: [CLUSTER:cluster_name].
    The following parameters can be configured for each cluster:
    - default_tz_uuid: This is uuid of the default NVP Transport zone that
    will be used for creating tunneled isolated "Quantum" networks. It
    needs to be created in NVP before starting Quantum with the nvp plugin.
        - nova_zone_id: Optional parameter identifying the Nova "zone" that maps
        to this NVP cluster.
        - nvp_cluster_uuid: Optional paramter identifying the UUID of the cluster
        in NVP.  This can be retrieved from NVP management console "admin" section.
        - nvp_controller_connetion: describes a connection to a single NVP
        controller. A different connection for each controller in the cluster can
        be specified; there must be at least one connection per cluster.

Quantum Configuration

    Modify your Quantum configuration for using the NVP Plugin:

    core_plugin =
        quantum.plugins.nicira.nicira_nvp_plugin.QuantumPlugin.NvpPluginV2
