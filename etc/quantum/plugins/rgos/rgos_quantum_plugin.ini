# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The
# default value 'local' is useful only for single-box testing and
# provides no connectivity between hosts. You MUST either change this
# to 'vlan' and configure network_vlan_ranges below for tenant
# networks to provide connectivity between hosts and switches.
#
# Default: tenant_network_type = local
# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan
tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are
# available for tenant network allocation if tenant_network_type is
# 'vlan'. If empty, only local networks may be created.

# Default: network_vlan_ranges =
# Example: network_vlan_ranges = physnet1:1000:2999

# This is the name of the OVS integration bridge. There is one per hypervisor.

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of <physical_network>:<bridge> tuples
# mapping physical network names to the agent's node-specific OVS
# bridge names to be used for flat and VLAN networks. Each bridge must
# exist, and should have a physical network interface configured as a
# port. All physical networks listed in network_vlan_ranges on the
# server should have mappings to appropriate bridges on each agent.
