# Sample Configurations

[DATABASE]
# This line MUST be changed to actually run the plugin.
# Example:
# sql_connection = mysql://root:nova@127.0.0.1:3306/ovs_quantum
# Replace 127.0.0.1 above with the IP address of the database used by the
# main quantum server. (Leave it as is if the database runs on this host.)
sql_connection = sqlite://
# Database reconnection retry times - in event connectivity is lost
# set to -1 implies an infinite retry count
# sql_max_retries = 10
# Database reconnection interval in seconds - in event connectivity is lost
reconnect_interval = 2

[OVS]
# Do not change this parameter unless you have a good reason to.
# This is the name of the OVS integration bridge. There is one per hypervisor.
# The integration bridge acts as a virtual "patch port". All VM VIFs are
# attached to this bridge and then "patched" according to their network
# connectivity.
integration_bridge = br-int

[AGENT]
# Agent's polling interval in seconds
polling_interval = 2
# Use "sudo quantum-rootwrap /etc/quantum/rootwrap.conf" to use the real
# root filter facility.
# Change to "sudo" to skip the filtering and just run the comand directly
root_helper = sudo

[OFC]
# Specify OpenFlow Controller Host, Port and Driver to connect.
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8888
# Drivers are in quantum/plugins/nec/drivers/ .
driver = trema
# PacketFilter is available when it's enabled in this configuration
# and supported by the driver.
enable_packet_filter = true
